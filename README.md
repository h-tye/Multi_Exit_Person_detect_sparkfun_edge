# Multi_Exit_Person_detect_sparkfun_edge
Implementation of multi exit network for person detection on sparkfun edge


This project makes slight modifications to the person detection project of this repo: https://github.com/advaitjain/tflite-micro-sparkfun-edge-examples/tree/main
I primarily altered main_functions.cc so a multi-exit model is run on every picture taken.
